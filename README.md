# Mercedes-Benz Kaggle Competition
This was is *first* repository, *first* time coding in Python, *first* time dabbling in this GitHub world, and *first* Kaggle Competition that I was lucky enough to participate in. My main intention was to just play around and learn.  

## Explaining the Commits
### MARS.py
MARS.py was the very first model I've *EVER* built in Python, so it's a very rough draft. No parameters were tuned or optimized in any way. I just wanted to see if my code would work/run.
### Data Processing.py 
Data Processing.py was just some rough data manipulations I did, playing with the **get_dummies** function and the **MinMaxScaler** module. 
### Data+Processing.ipynb 
Data+Processing.ipynb was me messing around in *Jupyter Notebook* for the first time. Still unfinished but I was trying (unsuccessfully) to set multiple values of a particular categorical variable to a particular value. *...to be continued*

## Notes on the Final Model
### XGBMBenz_Stacked+Luke+Chu.ipynb
XGBMBenz_Stacked+Luke+Chu.ipynb was the final model that Luke Chu, my teammate, coded. The entire commit was just me making notes along with minor edits to help me understand what was happening. Again, still under construction...

The unedited version of Luke's original commit along with the rest of the data from the training and test set can be found [here](https://github.com/yeere91/MercedesBenz/) at this repository.
